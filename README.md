This repo contains all of our tutorial's code related to the Esp32 coded with the help of [Platform IO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) (extension on [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Requirements

You will need an [Esp32](https://www.tmvtech.com/review-esp32-wroom-with-typec/) for all of the tutorials.

## How to use

This repo is setup in a way that running a project should be as easy as 'cd-ing' into it and opening vscode.

For example:

```sh
cd 01-led_blink
code .
```
